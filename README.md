## Configuration

The app uses OpenRouter API (free tier) for AI features. Without an API key, the app will still work but with limited AI features (generic responses instead of contextual AI feedback).

To get full AI features:

1. Visit https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your `.env` file

## Notes

- The app works offline for basic features
- AI features require internet connection and valid API key
- Speech recognition works in Chrome/Edge browsers

```
